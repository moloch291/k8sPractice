# Infrastructure Engineer Case Study

## Task pin points

- Create a production ready kubernetes cluster
  - You can use local VM-s or any viable solution like public cloud providers
  - Please don't use any managed kubernetes for example EKS, AKS or GKE
- Deploy a database on the cluster
  - You can use any database type best fit for the study
- Deploy Airflow on the cluster
- Use Airflow to load data from the `data/` directory to the database

## Misc

- Document the steps
- How would you extend your accomplished work further?
- Any other improvement you would implement? What would be the next steps once the infrastructure is stable?
- Any comment on the study

## Delivery

- Provide a single repository (hosted online or one single archive file) with the whole solution:
  - All the files you created to run the environment
  - Readme file explaining how to run the environment
  - Documentation folder with a document with the answers to the questions above and any other document you need to explain your solution
